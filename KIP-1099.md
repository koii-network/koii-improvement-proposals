**CopyNode Functionality and Browser Capabilities for Koii Nodes**

**Abstract:**  
This proposal introduces the CopyNode functionality, enabling users to automatically stake into all tasks that another node is staking into, thereby following that node's activities. This functionality will be integrated into the Koii node and extended across the ecosystem. Additionally, browser capabilities within the desktop node will be developed to support the CopyNode feature, allowing users to see and choose other nodes to copy, and to view past earnings.

**Motivation:**  
The CopyNode feature aims to simplify and enhance the staking experience by allowing users to follow successful nodes automatically. This will encourage broader participation and streamline user engagement within the ecosystem. It also highlights the need for enhanced privacy measures, which will be addressed in future proposals.

**Specification:**  
1. **CopyNode Functionality:**
   - Allow users to automatically stake into all tasks that another node is staking into.
   - Integrate this feature into the Koii node software and extend it to the ecosystem.

2. **Browser Capabilities:**
   - Develop desktop node browser capabilities to support the CopyNode feature.
   - Enable users to view and select nodes to copy and monitor their past earnings.

3. **Privacy Considerations:**
   - Address privacy concerns through potential node obfuscation measures in future iterations.
   - Consider implementing a ZK Name Service for enhanced privacy.

**Rationale:**  
The proposal aims to create a more engaging and user-friendly staking experience while laying the groundwork for future privacy enhancements.

**Implementation:**  
- Develop and integrate CopyNode functionality into the Koii node.
- Create browser capabilities for desktop nodes.
- Plan future proposals to address privacy needs and node obfuscation through a ZK Name Service.
